# Array Reversal Problem

An array is a data structure that stores elements of the same type in a contiguous block of memory. In an array, of size `n`, each memory location has some unique index, `i` (where `0 <= i < n`), that can be referenced as `arr[i]` or `arr[i]`.

## Task

Your task is to reverse an array of integers.

**Note:** If you've already solved our C++ domain's Arrays Introduction challenge, you may want to skip this.

## Example

Given an array, return the array in reversed order.

### Input Format

The first line contains an integer, `n`, the number of integers in the array.

The second line contains `n` space-separated integers that make up the array.

### Output Format

Return the reversed array.

### Function Description

Complete the function `reverseArray` with the following parameter(s):

- `arr`: the array to reverse.

#### Returns

- The reversed array.

### Sample Input 1

```
4
1 4 3 2
```

### Sample Output 1

```
2 3 4 1
```

### Explanation

The original array is `[1, 4, 3, 2]`. Reversed, it is `[2, 3, 4, 1]`.
